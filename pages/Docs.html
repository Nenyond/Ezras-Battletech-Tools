    <h4>Ezra's Battletech Tools</h4>
    <p><i>V0.1.1 Early Build</i></p>
    <p style="font-size: smaller; text-align: justify;">Comstar-bot is a set of utilities and automation functions designed to accompany the tabletop Battletech gameplay experience. It in no way is intended as a replacement for the rules to the game, or as a substitution for actually learning the rules. <br>I've included <i>some</i> rules references as a jog for memory or where I feel it would enhance the usefulness of the tools. <br>This site is optimized for viewing and use on mobile devices, because they are more convenient to use at the gaming table. Also, this means that whenever possible I have made UI/UX choices to prioritize mobile devices. This means a lot of buttons. <br>I've also intentionally kept the styling and aesthetics to a bare functional minimum to reduce page load and battery usage for mobile devices.</p>
    <h4>How to use</h4>
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">Most of the utilities are organized on their own pages and operate via a series of autoamted buttons that trigger some kind of javascript and return the appropriate function. </p>
